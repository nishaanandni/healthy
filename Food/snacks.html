<p>It's 3 pm and you're craving for food. Now what? Skip the deep-fried potato chips stashed away in your kitchen cupboard, and reach for a healthy snack instead. Nutritionist and Weight Management Expert, Gargi Sharma says, "Snacking prevents you from overeating later in the day, and actually boosts your metabolism which in turn, triggers weight loss and keeps your energy levels high. It is also an effective way to add extra nutrients in the diet which are usually missing from our daily food intake". Eat something that won't sabotage your weight-loss plans, especially if you still want to fit into your favourite pair of denims. Grab a whole grain cracker and dig into some guacamole packed with nutrients, or slather an apple with mouth-watering peanut butter. You can even spruce up a bowl of oatmeal with dark chocolate and berriesâ€¦ Umm, yum! </p>
