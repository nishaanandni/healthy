<p> Who doesn't wish for a wholesome lunch? But the times we live in today, getting even 15 minutes off to savour our meal seems like a distant reality. As such we tend to quickly grab a meal without caring much about the calories or the nutritional content, and this is where we go wrong, causing harm to ourselves. The lunch hours of the day are when our metabolism is at its peak. You're partially burned out and are looking forward to the first long break of the day. You might huddle in front of a television, eat at your desk or at the small table in your office cafeteria, but what you need to remember is that lunch helps you recover from the first half of your day and recharge you for what's about to come. Which is why it needs to be the ideal balance of protein, fiber, sugar and fat - basically all things good.</p>
