<p>A healthy dinner might give you a picture of bland and dull salads, flavourless bowls of food that might turn you off. Since the popular notion of healthy food remains to the date that it can't be delicious and appetising, we only think of boring dishes like a salad bowl, clear soups and anything that is tasteless. However, this is not really the case. You can eat healthy without compromising much on the taste and flavours because going healthy doesn't really mean banning all the carbs and fat from your diet. Indian cuisine is all about mouth-watering delicacies, packed with flavourful spices and herbs, cooked in oil and dollops of butter, and perhaps this is one of the reasons why we cannot imagine Indian food and healthy dinner together. </p><hr>
